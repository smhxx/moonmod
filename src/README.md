This directory should contain the MoonScript source code of your project. It can be organized in any way you want, but each script you want to output should have its own directory with its own `squishy` file. If you want to use `make save` to create your save file for you, then the **global** script should be output to `dist/global.lua` and any **object** scripts should be output to `dist/objects/<guid>.lua` where `guid` is the unique GUID of the object that you want the script to be attached to.
