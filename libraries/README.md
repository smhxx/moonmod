This folder should contain any libraries (other MoonMod projects) that you want to include as part of your script. These can be added by running `git submodule add https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git libraries/<repo-name>` from your repo's main directory. (If you use SSH remotes, you may run into problems with CI testing, since Travis won't have your SSH keys in order to log in.) After they are added, they can be included in your project by specifying the relative path to the `dist` files you want to include in your project's `squishy` configs.
