This folder should contain any libraries (other MoonMod projects) that you want to include as part of your script. These can be added by running `git submodule add git@github.com:<username>/<repo> libraries` from your repo's main directory. After they are added, they can be included in your project by specifying the relative path to the `dist` files you want to include in your project's `squishy` configs.
